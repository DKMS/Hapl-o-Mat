#Read in all possible alleles from allAlleles.txt. Create a translation for alleles from lower (2d, 6d, 8d) to 8 digit precision. Left column gives
#the allele and the right columns all extensions to higher precisions. To get a full list we also include translation from 8d to 8d.
#The list is written to AllAllelesExpanded.txt.
