Hapl-o-Mat -- Data Preparation
------------------------------

The data preparation requires the download and processing of some files. We
present you with two approaches, one automatically and one manually.


Automatically
-------------
Just run

    python BuildData.py

and all files are downloaded, processed, and moved to folder data 
automatically.


Manually
--------
1) Enter the folder prepareData. Download the relevant data files
   1.1) automatically via 

   	python DownloadData.py

   1.2) or manually via
      1.2.1) Go to the website http://hla.alleles.org/wmda/hla_nom_p.txt and
      save the file hla_nom_p.txt.

      1.2.2) Go to the website http://hla.alleles.org/wmda/hla_nom_g.txt and
      save the file hla_nom_g.txt.

      1.2.3) Go to the website https://bioinformatics.bethematchclinical.org/
      HLA-Resources/Allele-Codes/Allele-Code-Lists/
      Allele-Code-List-in-Alphabetical-Order/. Click on
      "Alphabetical Allele Code List (ZIP) (new nomenclature)" and save 
      alpha.v3.zip. Extract the archive to obtain alpha.v3.txt. You can
      remove the archive afterwards.

      1.2.4) You can choose between two options.
      	     1.2.4.1) Download the file
	     https://github.com/jrob119/IMGTHLA/raw/Latest/xml/
	     hla_ambigs.xml.zip. Extract the archive to obtain hla_ambigs.xml.
	     You can remove the archive afterwards.

	     1.2.4.2) Go to the website https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/
	     ambig.html. Click on "Download Excel" for the wanted release
	     (usually the latest) and save ambiguity_v<>.xls (replace <> by
	     version). Open ambiguity_v<>.xls in Excel and save as 
	     ambiguity_v<>.xlsm to run macros. Run the following macro which
	     saves relevant worksheets as .txt-files:

    	     Sub saveSheets()
	     '
	     '
	     Dim strPath As String, NameSheet As String, NameFile As String
	     Dim ws As Excel.Worksheet

    	     strPath = Application.ActiveWorkbook.Path
    
	     For i = 2 To Worksheets.Count

	     Worksheets(i).Activate
	     Set ws = ActiveSheet
	     ws.Copy

	     NameSheet = ActiveSheet.name
	     NameFile = strPath & "\" & NameSheet & ".txt"
	     ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:=NameFile, FileFormat:=xlText
	     ActiveWorkbook.Close False

	     Next i

	     End Sub

	     You can remove the Excel file afterwards.

2) If you require additional loci than the standard follow
   2.1) Create list of class 1 alleles of loci not included in hla_nom_g (HLA-E, HLA-F,
   HLA-G, HLA-H, HLA-J, HLA-K, HLA-L, HLA-P, HLA-V, HLA-Y) from
   http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/class1.html if you require those loci.

   2.2)Create list of class 2 alleles of loci not included in hla_nom_g (HLA-DMA,
   HLA-DMB, HLA-DOA, HLA-DOB, HLA-DRB6, HLA-DRB7, HLA-DRB8, HLA-DRB9, HLA-DRB10)
   from http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/class2.html if you require those loci.

3) Process the data files using the following these steps
   3.1) python BuildAllAllelesFrom_hla_nom_g.py
   3.2) Add alleles from 2) to allAlleles.txt
   3.3) python BuildAllAllelesExpanded.py
   3.4) python BuildP.py
   3.5)	python BuildLargeG.py
   3.6)	python BuildSmallg.py
   3.7) python AddAllelesMissingIngCode.py
   3.8) python TransferAlphaToMultipleAlleleCodes
   3.9) Depending on your choice in 1.2.4) run
   	3.8.1) python BuildAmbiguityFromXML.py if you worked with the xml file
   	3.8.1) python BuildAmbiguityFromTextFiles.py if you worked with the Excel file
   3.10) python AddGToAmbiguity.py

4) Move LargeG.txt, P.txt, Smallg.txt, Ambiguity.txt, MultipleAlleleCodes.txt,
and AllAllelesExpanded.txt to folder data.

5) If you want to analyse data in GL-format with unresolved genotypes (GL-id=0),
you can prepare the file AlleleList.txt from the GL-id input file by running
BuildAlleleList.py. Then move AlleleList.txt to data.

6) You can remove the files alpha.v3.txt, hla_ambigs.xml, hla_nom_g.txt, hla_nom_p.txt,
allAlleles.txt, and OneElementG.txt.
