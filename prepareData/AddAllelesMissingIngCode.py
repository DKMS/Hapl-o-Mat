#The small-g list created from G-P matching is not complete since some null-alleles exist which do not correspond to a large-G code.
#Since they are also missing in the P-list, they cannot appear in our small-g list. This script searches AllAllelexExpanded.txt for
#alleles missing in Smallg.txt. Note we only process alleles with loci dealt with in hla_nom_p.txt and hla_nom_g.txt
