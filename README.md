#Hapl-o-Mat v 1.0

##General information
Hapl-o-Mat is software for haplotype inference via an
expectation-maximization algorithm. It supports processing and
resolving various forms of HLA genotype data.

##The latest version
The latest version can be found on the Github server under
[https://github.com/DKMS/Hapl-o-Mat](https://github.com/DKMS/Hapl-o-Mat)

##Requirements
Installing Hapl-o-Mat requires a C++ compiler with C++11 support. To
produce the required data on HLA nomenclature python is required.

##Installing under Linux
Get Hapl-o-Mat via 
```
git clone https://github.com/DKMS/Hapl-o-Mat
```
Using GNU compiler collection (GCC), Hapl-o-Mat is compiled via a
Makefile:
```
make
make clean
```
If you use another compiler than GCC, adapt the compiler flags in
the Makefile, e.g. -march=native.

##Installing under Windows
A detailed explanation on how to install Hapl-o-Mat under Windows using
the Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers can be found in
detailedGettingStartedWindows.pdf.

##Usage
For information on how to use Hapl-o-Mat and some tutorials using Linux
follow the guide detailedGettingStartedLinux.pdf or gettingStarted if you
are a seasoned Linux user. If you use Windows, follow the guide 
detailedGettingStartedWindows.pdf
