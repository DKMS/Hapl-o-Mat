Hapl-o-Mat -- System Test
-------------------------
The system test intends to test the functionality of the Hapl-o-Mat after changes to the source code 
by comparing run results from before and after the changes for different scenarios.

The system test requires python3

Part 1: Create files for comparison before changing Hapl-o-Mat source code.
- Compile the executable haplomat
- Prepare the data files using prepareData/BuildData.py
- Create AllelList.txt from the input file GLS_b/b.glid using prepareData/BuildAlleleList.py
  and move to to data
- Run CleanSystemTest.py to delete all files from previous system tests.
- Run CreateFileForComparison.py to create the results for comparison

Part 2: Make your changes to the code of Hapl-o-Mat

Part 3: Run system test after changing Hapl-o-Mat source code
- Run SystemTest.py to check if you broke Hapl-o-Mat with
  your code changes.
- The system test does not cover every feature of Hapl-o-Mat
